# Logan's Dotfiles!

- Here is a repository of all of my files containing various different configurations that I use on the daily!
- There are 2 primary types of files you can find:
  1. Program configurations
  2. Scripts/terminal configurations
- The program configurations relate to various styling and/or plugins used to run my programs (Neovim, Hyprland, Waybar, etc.)
- The Scripts are... Well, scripts! They help automate my processes to make my life easier
